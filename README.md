Key features of the application include:

Real-time display of current price, market capitalization, 24-hour volume, and percentage price change

A dynamic, interactive 24-hour price chart using Plotly for visual analytics

User input functionality for selecting any supported cryptocurrency

Clean and responsive UI enhanced with custom background support
